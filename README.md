Odin-recipes.

This is my first journey in a Odin project course, and I am excited to find out what I can do.

Although english is not my native languge, I find the project friendly to understand for a starter-English-learner.


I'm about to demonstrate what I'm able to do with some HTML classes.'

Usage of:

-HTML Tags as : <hX> for titles and subtitles. 
<a> for links, and navigation within the project. <img> for images. 

I think it is going to be simple although I can do it better because I have some knowledge of JS and CSS. I'm going to do it simple for now, but one day I hope that I can make it better.
