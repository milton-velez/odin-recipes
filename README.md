# Recipes Odin project.

This is my first journey in a Odin project course, and I am excited to find out what I can do.

Although english is not my native languge, I find the project friendly to understand for a starter-English-learner.

I'm about to demonstrate what I'm able to do with some HTML classes.



### Some learning I did.

* h1,h2,h3,... tags.
* p tags
* img tags
* lists
    * unorder
    * ordered
* editing size of img's
* usage of git
    * push
    * clone
    * pull
    * good commit messages
    * etc

Well, I have learned some stuff more, but I'm excited to keep learning the path Odin Project made.
