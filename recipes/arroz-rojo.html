    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mexican red rice is easy to make and authentic in taste! Use a different chile if you want milder or hotter rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 Roma (plum tomatoes), cored</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>¼ cup canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 jalapeno pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 sprigs fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Grate tomatoes into a bowl using a box grater; discard tomato skins.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

    <li>Stir in jalapeño pepper, cilantro, and salt; reduce heat to low. Cover the skillet and simmer until liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Do not lift the cover while rice is cooking.</li>
